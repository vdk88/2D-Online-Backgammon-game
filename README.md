# 2D-Online-Backgammon-game
A multiplayer 2D board game starter kit for developers

The Cool Backgammon is a starter package for development purposes and is not a full game. It means that developer can use it as a base and do further development on it. For example, they can create an administration panel for the game and connect it to the existing back-end in order to controll the users better.
Some of the features shown in the images or those that are not mentioned explicitly may have been implemented partially and need more development in order to be used, or may be implemented in the future releases of the Cool Backgammon.
